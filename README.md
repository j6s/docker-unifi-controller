# Unifi Controller Docker Container

This is a simple docker container that runs the unifi controller with all of it's dependencies inside of a container.
It's a single container that runs both, the java app as well as the mongodb database that comes bundled with it.

This does not adhere to the best practises of developing docker containers as there are multiple processes running
in the same container - however the database ships with the unifi controller and is started by the application itself -
separating the two would be a bigger undertaking.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository and run `docker-compose up`. That's it.
The directory `data/` will contain the data generated by the application.
